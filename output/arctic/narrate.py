 "How did four lads from Sheffield become one of the biggest bands in the world? Let's go back to two thousand and two.",
 "Step one. High Green, Sheffield. Alex Turner and Jamie Cook pick up guitars. Their school friends join them. Matt Helders on drums. Andy Nicholson on bass.",
 "Step two. June, two thousand and three. Their first ever gig, at The Grapes pub in Sheffield. They're sixteen. They get paid twenty seven pounds.",
 "Step three. They burn demo CDs, and give them away free at gigs. Fans share the songs online. A fan even makes them a MySpace page. Soon, crowds know every word.",
 "Step four. June, two thousand and five. They sign to Domino Records. That October, I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor goes straight to number one.",
 "Step five. January, two thousand and six. Their debut album sells three hundred and sixty three thousand copies in one week. The fastest selling debut album in UK history.",
 "Step six. That summer, Andy leaves. Nick O'Malley joins on bass. In September, they win the Mercury Prize.",
 "Step seven. In twenty thirteen, their album AM takes them worldwide. Seven Brit Awards. Three Glastonbury headline shows.",
 "From a pub gig for twenty seven pounds, to the biggest stages on Earth. Which era is your favourite? Comment below.",
