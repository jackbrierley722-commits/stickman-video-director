 "But you are never alone. Even the bathroom has a queue.",
 "Island B is shaped like a dollar sign. The water is emerald green, and the coconuts are full of cash. Money really does grow on trees.",
 "But there is nothing to buy. The nearest shop is a thousand miles away. Like and follow, because island D is the strangest.",
 "Island C looks normal. Until you notice a leaf, frozen in the air. The water is still as glass. Here, you never get older.",
 "But if you ever step off, every year catches up with you at once.",
