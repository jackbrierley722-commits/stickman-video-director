 "Sounds perfect. ~ But you are never alone. Even the bathroom has a queue.",
 "Island B? A dollar sign. The water is emerald green. And the coconuts? ~ Full of cash. Money really does grow on trees.",
 "There is just one problem. ~ There is nothing to buy. The nearest shop is a thousand miles away. Like and follow. The last island is the strangest.",
 "The third island looks normal. ~ Until you notice a leaf. Frozen. In mid air. The water is still as glass. Here, you never get older.",
 "Not one day. ~ But if you ever step off, every year catches up with you. All at once.",
 "And the last island? ~ Twisted spiral trees. Purple water that sparkles. Every morning, you get a random superpower. Yesterday, your neighbour could fly.",
